# OOPY2A3
OOP Fundamentals working on Inheritance. 

The folder src contains the code of the Java application.  
o MyMain.java => This class tests the functionality of Lab04. This class is 
provided completed, so you must not modify it.  
o Animal.java => Our parent class in the class hierarchy, modelling the concept 
of an animal. You must complete this class. 
o Dog.java => Our first child class in the class hierarchy, modelling the concept 
of a dog. You must complete this class.  
o Cat.java => Our second child class in the class hierarchy, modelling the concept 
of a cat. You must complete this class. 
o GoldenRetriever.java => Our grandchild class in the class hierarchy, modelling 
the concept of, specifically, a Golden Retriever dog. You must complete this 
class.  
o DogToy.java => Our class example for a has-a relationship. This class is not 
part of the class hierarchy. However, all dogs (that is, Dog.java and 
GoldenRetriever.java have a field representing the dog toy). This class is 
provided completed, so you must not modify it. 
The folder javadoc contains the documentation of the Java application.  
o MyMain.html => This file contains the description of the class MyMain.java. 
As the class is provided completed use this file just as a reference.  
o Animal.html => This file contains the description of the fields, constructor, get 
and set methods of the class Animal.java. Use this file to guide you in 
completing the code of the file Animal.java. 
o Dog.html => This file contains the description of the fields, constructor, get 
methods, set methods and extra functionality of the class Dog.java. Use this file 
to guide you in completing the code of the file Dog.java.  
o Cat.html => This file contains the description of the fields, constructor, get 
methods, set methods and extra functionality of the class Cat.java. Use this file 
to guide you in completing the code of the file Cat.java.  
o GoldenRetriever.html => This file contains the description of the fields, 
constructor, get methods, set methods and extra functionality of the class 
GoldenRetriever.java. Use this file to guide you in completing the code of the 
file GoldenRetriever.java.  
o DogToy.html => This file contains the description of the fields, constructor, get 
and set methods of the class DogToy.java. As the class is provided completed 
use this file just as a reference.  - 
The folder results contains the expected results of the Java application.  
o result_option_1.txt => This file contains the output obtained from running the 
lecturer’s solution when using <option = 1> in the main method of 
MyMain.java. That is, when the Java application is used to test the functionality 
of the class Animal.  
o result_option_2.txt => This file contains the output obtained from running the 
lecturer’s solution when using <option = 2> in the main method of 
MyMain.java. That is, when the Java application is used to test the functionality 
of the class Dog. 
o result_option_3.txt => This file contains the output obtained from running the 
lecturer’s solution when using <option = 3> in the main method of 
MyMain.java. That is, when the Java application is used to test the functionality 
of the class Cat. 
o result_option_4.txt => This file contains the output obtained from running the 
lecturer’s solution when using <option = 4> in the main method of 
MyMain.java. That is, when the Java application is used to test the functionality 
of the class GoldenRetriever. 
Actions: 
1. Complete the classes Animal.java, Dog.java, Cat.java and GoldenRetriever.java.  
The fields, constructor, get methods, set methods and extra functionality must follow 
the description given by the Javadoc files Animal.html, Dog.html, Cat.html and 
GoldenRetriever.html, respectively.
